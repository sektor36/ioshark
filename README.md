- **Administrative Privileges** 🔑 (Required for sniffing and spoofing)

## 🚀 Usage

### 🔍 Packet Sniffing
Monitor and analyze network packets on a specific interface:
```sh
python ioshark.py -i eth0 --sniff
```

### 🎭 ARP Spoofing
Intercept network traffic by executing an ARP spoofing attack:
```sh
python ioshark.py -i eth0 --arp TARGET_IP GATEWAY_IP
```

### 🔗 DNS Tunneling
Establish covert communication using DNS tunneling:
```sh
python ioshark.py -i eth0 --dns
```

### 📂 Analyze a `.pcap` File
Extract and analyze packets from a Wireshark capture file:
```sh
python ioshark.py -w capture.pcap
```
