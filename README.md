iOshark: Network Sniffer & Exploitation Tool

iOshark is a powerful network analysis tool written in Python that enables packet sniffing, ARP spoofing, and DNS tunneling. It utilizes Scapy to capture and manipulate network packets for various network-based attacks and analysis.

Whether you're a cybersecurity enthusiast, network administrator, or a penetration tester, iOshark allows you to intercept network traffic, spoof ARP requests, and conduct DNS tunneling attacks with ease.
‚öôÔ∏è Features

    Packet Sniffing: Capture and analyze network packets on any given interface (e.g., wlan0).

    ARP Spoofing: Perform ARP poisoning to redirect network traffic between devices.

    DNS Tunneling: Establish communication through DNS queries and responses.

    Wireshark Capture File Analysis: Read and analyze .pcap files captured by Wireshark.

    Cross-platform Support: Works on Linux, macOS, and potentially Windows (with some modifications).

üì¶ Installation

To use iOshark, you'll need Python 3.x and some dependencies. Follow these steps to get started:
1. Install Dependencies

First, install Scapy, the main dependency for packet manipulation:

pip install scapy

2. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ioshark.git
cd ioshark

üõ†Ô∏è Usage

After installing, you can use iOshark to sniff network traffic, perform ARP spoofing, or analyze .pcap files.
üì° Sniffing Network Traffic

To start sniffing traffic on a specific network interface (e.g., wlan0):

python3 ioshark.py -i wlan0 --sniff

üíª ARP Spoofing

To perform ARP spoofing (Poisoning) between a target and a gateway:

python3 ioshark.py --arp <TARGET_IP> <GATEWAY_IP> -i <INTERFACE>

Example:

python3 ioshark.py --arp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.1 -i wlan0

üåê DNS Tunneling

To start DNS tunneling on a specific interface:

python3 ioshark.py --dns -i wlan0

üìÇ Analyzing .pcap Files

To analyze a .pcap file (captured using Wireshark or any other tool):

python3 ioshark.py -w capture_file.pcap

üîß Command-Line Arguments
Argument	Description
-i, --interface	Network interface to use (e.g., wlan0, eth0)
-w, --pcap	Analyze a Wireshark .pcap file for packet details
--sniff	Sniff network traffic in real-time
--arp	Perform ARP spoofing (Target IP and Gateway IP required)
--dns	Start DNS tunneling
üìù Example Use Cases
1. Sniffing Network Traffic

To capture and analyze network packets on the wlan0 interface:

python3 ioshark.py -i wlan0 --sniff

2. ARP Spoofing Attack

To poison the ARP cache and redirect traffic between a target (e.g., 192.168.1.5) and the gateway (e.g., 192.168.1.1):

python3 ioshark.py --arp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.1 -i wlan0

3. DNS Tunneling

To start DNS tunneling to communicate via DNS requests:

python3 ioshark.py --dns -i wlan0

4. Analyzing a .pcap File

To analyze the packets in a .pcap file (e.g., capture.pcap):

python3 ioshark.py -w capture.pcap
